1, Project title: Retail Billing System

2, Project Issue:

The project aims to streamline the billing process in retail environments, focusing on creating an efficient and user-friendly system to manage sales transactions.

Problem to be Solved:

Retailers face challenges in manually tracking sales, managing items, and generating accurate bills quickly. A retail billing system automates these processes, reduces human errors, and speeds up the transaction experience for customers.

3. Current Progress (PDLC):
Problem Analysis: Identified the need for an automated billing system to replace manual methods of calculating and tracking sales.
Design: The system is designed to handle basic retail transactions, including adding items, calculating totals, and generating receipts. It's built with a simple user interface to make it easy for cashiers to use without technical knowledge.
Development: The core functionalities (item addition, total calculation, receipt generation) are implemented. The code also includes handling discounts, applying tax rates, and calculating total amounts due.
Testing: The system has been tested for basic functionality like adding products, calculating totals, and generating receipts. Further testing will be done to ensure it works smoothly in a live environment.
4. Project Functions/Features:
Add Items: The system allows for the addition of items to the cart, specifying their price and quantity.
Calculate Total: The system automatically calculates the subtotal, tax, and total amount due.
Generate Receipt: After completing the transaction, the system generates a printable receipt that includes itemized details, total amount, and payment status.
Discounts: The system supports applying discounts to specific items or the total bill.
Tax Calculation: Tax is automatically calculated based on predefined tax rates.
User-Friendly Interface: A straightforward interface that allows cashiers to quickly process transactions with minimal input.
